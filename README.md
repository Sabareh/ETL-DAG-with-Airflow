# Basic ETL DAG for Top-Level Domain Analysis with Airflow

## Description:
Welcome to myBasic ETL DAG repository designed for analyzing top-level domains (TLDs) using Apache Airflow. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for extracting, transforming, and loading data related to top-level domains, allowing users to gain insights into domain usage trends, popularity, and other relevant metrics.

## Key Features:

1. **ETL Workflow:** This repository includes a robust Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) workflow implemented using Apache Airflow, a powerful platform for orchestrating complex data workflows. The workflow is structured into distinct tasks, ensuring efficient data processing from source to destination.

2. **Data Extraction:** Utilizing various data sources such as domain registration databases, DNS records, and web traffic logs, the ETL pipeline efficiently extracts relevant data pertaining to top-level domains. This ensures a comprehensive dataset for subsequent analysis.

3. **Data Transformation:** The extracted data undergoes transformation processes to standardize formats, cleanse inconsistencies, and enrich with additional metadata. Transformation tasks are implemented using pandas python libarry and Airflow operators, ensuring data quality and consistency.

4. **Customizable Configuration:** Users can easily customize the ETL workflow and analysis tasks according to their specific requirements. Configuration files and parameters are provided, facilitating seamless integration with diverse data sources and analytical tools.

## Usage Guide:

1. **Setup Environment:** Follow the provided instructions to set up the development environment, ensuring compatibility with Apache Airflow and required Python dependencies.

2. **Configure Data Sources:** Configure data source connections and authentication credentials as per your environment setup. Ensure proper access permissions for data extraction tasks.

3. **Run ETL Workflow:** Execute the predefined Airflow DAGs to initiate the ETL workflow. Monitor task execution status and logs to ensure successful data processing.

4. **Explore Analysis Results:** Once the ETL workflow completes, explore the generated analysis results and visualizations to gain insights into top-level domain usage patterns, trends, and anomalies.

5. **Customize and Extend:** Modify the provided DAGs, tasks, and transformation logic to tailor the analysis to specific use cases. Experiment with different data sources and analytical techniques to uncover deeper insights.
